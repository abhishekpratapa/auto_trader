# BUILD

This is also super sparse but I'll make it better.

## Prerequisites

- Boost
- CMake

Mac
Windows
Linux

## Compiling

run `./configure`
go to using cd `builds/Debug`
run `make -j8`

Walla!! The source and tests will be built into a targets folder as well as some intermediary libs (Anyone willing to re-factor these into intermediary object representations rather than static libs will be my savior).
